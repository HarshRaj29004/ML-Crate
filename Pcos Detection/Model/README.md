# Pcos Detection

## 🎯 GOAL

The aim of the project is to build a model which would predict whether a person has PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome).

## 🧵 DATASET

The dataset was taken from Kaggle.

## 🧾 DESCRIPTION

In this project, we compare the accuracies of different models to predict PCOS in a person.

## 🧮 WHAT I HAD DONE

Steps followed:
* Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
* Checked for null values and performed exploratory data analysis.
* Built models using the following algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest.
* Compared the accuracies.
* Then performed cross-validation on all the algorithms to see if the accuracies improve.

## 🚀 Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Adaboost
6. Naive Bayes
7. Support Vector Machine
8. K-Nearest Neighbors

## 📚 LIBRARIES NEEDED

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Sklearn

## 📈 Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores

| Classifier              | Accuracy   |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Logistic Regression     | 0.703704   |
| Decision Tree           | 0.629630   |
| Random Forest           | 0.685185   |
| Gradient Boosting       | 0.731481   |
| AdaBoost                | 0.685185   |
| Naive Bayes             | 0.518519   |
| Support Vector Machine  | 0.305556   |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 0.694444   |

## 📢 CONCLUSION

From this project, we conclude that Gradient Boosting has the highest accuracy among all the algorithms, followed by Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and KNN.
