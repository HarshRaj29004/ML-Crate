## Body Fat Prediction - Web Interface

### Goal 🎯
The main goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use web interface for predicting body fat percentage based on user input parameters. This tool aims to make body fat prediction accessible to non-technical users by integrating a machine learning model with a user-friendly Flask web application.

### Model(s) used for the Web App 🧮
The backend part of the web app uses a pre-trained machine learning model (`../Model`) serialized with `pickle`. The model was trained on a dataset of body measurements and is designed to predict body fat percentage accurately.
