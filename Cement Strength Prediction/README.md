# Cement Strength Prediction

This Folder contains the code and resources for predicting the compressive strength of
concrete using various machine learning models. The prediction is based on the ingredients of
concrete, such as cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate,
and fine aggregate.
