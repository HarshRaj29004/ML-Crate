### 🧾 **Description**

The project aims to analyze the ACI IoT Network Traffic Dataset 2023 to identify patterns and anomalies in network traffic. The goal is to build an accurate predictive model for network anomaly detection.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

Load the data using appropriate tools and conduct an initial inspection to identify missing values and outliers. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships. Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers, and engineer new features if necessary. Split the data into training and testing sets, scaling features as needed. Build and evaluate various models. Finalize the best model, evaluate it on the test set, and prepare it for deployment. Document each step and report the findings to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
